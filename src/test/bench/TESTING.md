Run scripts from rcmaster. 

Run generateFigures.sh to create CDFs of latencies with 100%, 95%, and 90%
commutative requests and throughput vs latency for 100%, 95%, and 90% comutative
requests. Graphs created in current working directory.

Uses rc20-25 (to change this, change IP addresses in generateCdf.py and
generateThroughputVsLatency.py).
